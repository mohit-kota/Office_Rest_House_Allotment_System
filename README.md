# Railways Resting Rooms Booking System

This project is a 24/7 web application developed using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and PHP (Laravel) to facilitate efficient booking of resting rooms nationwide for railway officials. The application incorporates various features to ensure fair allocation of booking slots and offers a dual-interface system for users and administrators to streamline the room booking and management processes. Additionally, an email verification system has been integrated to enhance security and validate user information.

## Key Features

- **24/7 Access:** The web application allows railway officials to book resting rooms at any time of the day, ensuring convenient access to accommodation.

- **Time-Based Condition Booking:** To prevent manipulation of booking slots, a time-based condition system has been implemented. This ensures fair allocation of rooms even if users attempt to manipulate their device time settings.

- **Dual-Interface System:** The application provides a user-friendly booking interface for railway officials to make room reservations easily. Simultaneously, administrators have access to an efficient room management system to oversee bookings and availability.

- **Email Verification:** A robust email verification system has been integrated to enhance the security of user accounts and validate the authenticity of user information during the registration process.
